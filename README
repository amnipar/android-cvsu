android-cvsu v.0.1.0

Author: Matti J. Eskelinen <matti.j.eskelinen@gmail.com>

This is the cvsu demo application for Android. It requires installing also
OpenCV Manager on the device, and links dynamically to the opencv library. It
utilizes opencv for intercepting camera frames and analyzing them before drawing
on screen.

Compiling this app will require Android NDK and OpenCV SDK for Android. Detailed
instructions will follow at a later time.

Compiling requires also cloning or symlinking the cvsu repository to
subdirectory jni/cvsu.
